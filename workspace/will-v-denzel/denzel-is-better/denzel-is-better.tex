\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

\doublespacing

There are several ways to measure success as an actor, including votes,
millions earned, ratings, metacritic ratings, and the breadth and depth
of genres in which the actor has acted. The votes show how well-liked
the actor's movies are, with more votes reflecting superior acting
performance. The millions of dollars each movie earns is an important
measure of an actor's success. Higher earnings reflect better
performance. High ratings also reflect excellent acting. The ability to
act in mulitiple genres demonstrates flexibility and high level of
skill.

Denzel Washington has demonstrated excellence in acting through
consistent ratings, high earnings, high numbers of votes, and a good
depth and breadth of acting experience. In each of these dimensions,
Washington has shown that he is superior to other actors such as Will
Smith.

\newpage
\section{ Comparison to Will Smith}
\label{sec:da}

longest film Washington has acted in is 202 minutes, 45 minutes longer

rating. These consistently high ratings show superior acting
performance.

30, 50\% higher than Smith's lowest. The highest metacritic rating
Washington has received is 79, a higher score than Smith's highest
metacritic rating. Washington has a mean metacritic rating of 61, which

\section{ Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The assessment of excellence in acting requires multiple measures
including votes received, ratings, metacritic ratings, millions of
dollars earned, and the depth and breadth of acting experience. These
measures work together to show how well-liked the actor's movies are,
the monetary value of these movies, and the actor's flexibility and
height of skill. On each of these dimensions, Denzel Washington has
shown himself superior to actors like Will Smith, consistently
displaying excellence in acting.
