# Data Provenance

How good is your data?  Have you documented your data?

## Running Records

For example, there is a dataset floating around on the internet that I used in the university course I took several years ago on multivariate statistics.  

- <https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/bbm%3A978-0-387-73508-5%2F1.pdf>
- <http://sfb649.wiwi.hu-berlin.de/fedc_homepage/xplore/tutorials/mvahtmlnode145.html>
- <https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-0-387-73508-5>

I guess it contains "fastest-times" for men athletes in several races by country.  Based on the data available, I am guessing it was "as-of" the 1988 Summer Olympics held in South Korea <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletics_at_the_1988_Summer_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_100_metres>?  Or maybe 1976 Summer Olympics held in Canada <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletics_at_the_1976_Summer_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_100_metres>?  Or maybe the 1987 World Championships held in Rome Italy <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1987_World_Championships_in_Athletics_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_100_metres>?

We know it mentions some countries but not others.  Where is Jamaica?  Where is Trinidad and Tobago?

Ultimately, one can conjecture based on several data points.  It appears the Ben Johnson (Canada) world records were erased, but he fastest time was the US time of Carl Lewis in Rome, Italy. [Ironically, Carl Lewis was also doing the dirty with drugs, but the US conveniently covered it up as they wanted to beat the Russians:  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Lewis#Use_of_stimulants> and <https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/apr/24/athletics.duncanmackay>]

Sidebar:  This demonstrate the concept of PIP in Human Performance theory; that is,  potential for improving performance <https://hptmanual.weebly.com/pip.html>

If you run the 100m in 30 seconds, it is rather easy with coaching to shave 10 seconds off your time.  But PIP lowers as you get more proficient.  This same principle applies to any apprenticeship/coaching domain, including this class.

## Garbage In Garbage Out (GIGO)

This dataset is a nice example to understand what HORRIBLE data provenance is.  We don't fully understand the time or methods of the data collection.  We can't trust the data because even Carl Lewis and 100's of other Americans were doping (enhancing illegally) to guarantee they would be the best in the world (during the cold war with Russia then called the USSR).

### Data Import

#### Text Import
```{r}
data.file = paste0(github.monte, "humanVerse/main/data/running-records/running-records.txt");  

running.txt = readFromPipe(data.file);
# notice, it did not like a column name starting with a number.
```

#### RDS Import
```{r}
# https://github.com/MonteShaffer/humanVerse/blob/main/data/running-records/running-records.rds?raw=true

data.file = paste0(github.monte, "humanVerse/main/data/running-records/running-records.rds");  

running.rds = readRDS(url(data.file));
# notice, this binary form didn't care about the column name format ...
```

### Match times (all in seconds)
```{r}
running.df = running.rds;
running.df$`800m.secs` = 60 * running.df$`800m.mins`;
running.df$`1500m.secs` = 60 * running.df$`1500m.mins`;
running.df$`5000m.secs` = 60 * running.df$`5000m.mins`;
running.df$`10000m.secs` = 60 * running.df$`10000m.mins`;
running.df$`marathon.secs` = 60 * running.df$`marathon.mins`;
```

### hclust

#### Country-level Analysis
```{r}
X = as.matrix(running.df[,c(2:4, 10:14)]) ;
  rownames(X) = running.df$Country;
  colnames(X) = c("100m", "200m", "400m", "800m", "1500m", "5000m", "10000m", "marathon"); # all in seconds
Xs = scale(X);
# you can change which X is being used: X or Xs
whichX = X;
```

```{r}
X.d = dist(whichX);  # Euclidean Distance

X.hclust = hclust(X.d);  # method = "complete"
plot(X.hclust, main="Countries (complete)");
```

```{r}
X.hclust = hclust(X.d, method="ward.D2");
plot(X.hclust, main="Countries (ward.D2)");
```

##### Cutting the Tree into Clusters
```{r}
numberClusters = 8;

X.cut = stats::cutree(X.hclust, k=numberClusters);
table(X.cut);
X.cut;
```

##### Subtrees
```{r}

library(dendextend);
colors = colorspace::rainbow_hcl(numberClusters);

dend = stats::as.dendrogram(X.hclust);
dend = dendextend::color_branches(dend, k = numberClusters);

  graphics::par(mfrow = c(1,1));
  graphics::plot(dend, main="Countries (ward.D2)", ylim=c(0, ceiling(max(X.hclust$height))) );  # Can I color-code the labels?  "Fe"

# maybe make custom ceiling approach that rounds to a significant digit ... 76425 -> 77000 or 76500
```

```{r}

dend.labels = base::labels(dend);
  groups = dendextend::cutree(dend, k=numberClusters, order_clusters_as_data = FALSE);

graphics::par(mfrow = c(2,2));

dends = list();
for(i in 1:numberClusters)
  {
  keep.me    = dend.labels[i != groups];
  dends[[i]] = dendextend::prune(dend, keep.me);
  graphics::plot(dends[[i]], cex=0.5, main = paste0("SubTree number ", i) );  # , ylim=c(0,100)
  }

# restore plot
  graphics::par(mfrow = c(1,1));
  
```

#### Event-level Analysis
```{r}
X = as.matrix(running.df[,c(2:4, 10:14)]) ;
  rownames(X) = running.df$Country;
X = transposeMatrix(X);

Xs = scale(X);
# you can change which X is being used: X or Xs
whichX = X;
```

```{r}
X.d = dist(whichX);  # Euclidean Distance

X.hclust = hclust(X.d);  # method = "complete"
plot(X.hclust, main="Events (complete)");
```

```{r}
X.hclust = hclust(X.d, method="ward.D2");
plot(X.hclust, main="Events (ward.D2)");
```

##### Cutting the Tree into Clusters
```{r}
numberClusters = 3;

X.cut = stats::cutree(X.hclust, k=numberClusters);
table(X.cut);
X.cut;
```

##### Subtrees
```{r}

library(dendextend);
colors = colorspace::rainbow_hcl(numberClusters);

dend = stats::as.dendrogram(X.hclust);
dend = dendextend::color_branches(dend, k = numberClusters);

  graphics::par(mfrow = c(1,1));
  graphics::plot(dend, main="Events (ward.D2)", ylim=c(0, ceiling(max(X.hclust$height))) );  # Can I color-code the labels?  "Fe"

```

```{r}

dend.labels = base::labels(dend);
  groups = dendextend::cutree(dend, k=numberClusters, order_clusters_as_data = FALSE);

graphics::par(mfrow = c(2,2));

dends = list();
for(i in 1:numberClusters)
  {
  keep.me    = dend.labels[i != groups];
  dends[[i]] = dendextend::prune(dend, keep.me);
  graphics::plot(dends[[i]], cex=0.5, main = paste0("SubTree number ", i) );  # , ylim=c(0,100)
  }

# restore plot
  graphics::par(mfrow = c(1,1));
  
```

### PCA

```{r}
X = as.matrix(running.df[,c(2:4, 10:14)]) ;
  rownames(X) = running.df$Country;
# X = transposeMatrix(X);

Xs = scale(X);

Xs.PCA = stats::prcomp(Xs);
Xs.SVD = base::svd(Xs);
VAF = summary(Xs.PCA)$importance[2,];
```

#### Biplots
```{r}

```

# Conclusion 

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres#Men_(outdoor)>

Who the outliers from these countries may be very difficult to discover because the Soviet era doesn't seem to have a lot of balanced records.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men%27s_200_metres_world_record_progression>

Maybe Muriaroa Ngaro (1980) was the runner associated with the marathon from the Cook Islands <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Cook_Islands_records_in_athletics#Men>

In 1980, he ran the marathon in 2:51:26 ... The winning time was 2:11:03 run by German Waldemar Cierpinski (East Germany).  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletics_at_the_1980_Summer_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_marathon>

So maybe Muriaroa Ngaro was an extreme outlier because he was so slow.

1980 the USA boycotted the USSR-hosted olympics.
1984 the USSR boycotted the USA-hosted olympics.

- Copy/Paste is your Friend.  Notice how I label the variables generically `X` so I can re-use the code.  I re-used code from `PCA-SVD.Rmd` as well.
- Good data provenance means you can document everything about your data.  Many times this means you have multiple notebooks documenting each stage of "data development".  For this reason, it is better to keep things independent and modular.  When in doubt, make another notebook.
- Think about the process like a "chain-of-custody" approach that you see on TV detective shows.  Each step should be a separate notebook, and each notebook should be able to run to reproduce the data.  Starting from nothing to a final report, each step is documented and can be tweaked.  Iteration is a key feature of proficient data provenance.
